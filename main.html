            Hiiiii, Lluvie hereeee!!!! so i just wanted to say some few things (haven't thought about it yet)
            So I just wanna say how happy I am that I met you, How happy I am that I "took the risk" I don't remember when i had a year where i was as happy as i was last year.. This year has been kinda bumpy, but im so happy you're still here. I care about and love you so muchhh.. I hope we end up together.. Imagine how amazing it'll be. I want it to happen. I want to spend forever with you. Also you're weird but idrc cause im weird too.. and omg youre so fineeeeeeee. 
            I hope you're able to get all your hearts desires esp if some of them include meeee. idrk what to say again apart from how happy i am that i met you and how i love you and idk if i show it enough but i do. i think thats all.. idrkkkkkkkkkkkkkk.. 
            <br>
